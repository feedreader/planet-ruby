## There are lots of CLI currency converters, what's unique about Lumione?

It doesn't use an API. No API - no token setup needed and no limits on usage.
Also:
  * API changes won't break it.
  * It actually works and is likely to keep working. I've seen my share of
    broken CLI currency calculators.
  * It uses [Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money), and it's a stable
    interface.

Some caveats about rates:
  * It has support only for the currencies that [eu_central_bank](https://github.com/RubyMoney/eu_central_bank) gem supports. It
    was a tradeoff favouring development speed and maintenance.
  * EU central bank rates are updated not in real time. I find it's good enough
    for casual conversations about prices.
  * Lumione updates rates every 24 hours (if you run it), but EU central bank
    may not update them as often, so sometimes rates go unchanged for a couple
    of days.

## How to use it

```
$lumione 13 nzd usd
$13.00 NZD ($9.16 USD) (rates updated 3 days ago)
```

Install with `gem install lumione`.

## To speed up development, I used a Rails ActionView helper

I was after using
[#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper/distance_of_time_in_words).
You could see in action earlier, when you saw "(rates updated 3 days ago)". "3
days ago" was generated by `#distance_of_time_in_words`.

Many people suggest reimplementing things, rather than adding dependencies, but
I don't believe in that. I'd rather save time and use somebody else's code. Of
course, dependencies should be chosen carefully.

To use `#distance_of_time_in_words` outside Rails is easy:
```
require "active_support/core_ext/numeric/time"
require "action_view"

class Foo
  include ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper

  def foo
    distance_of_time_in_words 3.minutes
  end
end

puts Foo.new.foo
```

## To speed up development, I used optparse-plus gem

Handling CLI arguments and options can be annoying and require effort, but not
so with [optparse-plus](https://github.com/davetron5000/optparse-plus).

For example, CLI arguments are defined like this:
```
arg :amount
arg :original_currency
arg :converted_to_currency
```

And, when I run `lumione`, I get this:
```
Usage: lumione [options] amount original_currency converted_to_currency

Convert money in one currency into another

v0.1.0

Options:
    -h, --help                       Show command line help
        --version                    Show help/version info
        --log-level LEVEL            Set the logging level
                                     (debug|info|warn|error|fatal)
                                     (Default: info)
```

All automatic! And it'll tell user if an arument is missing.

And, [optparse-plus](https://github.com/davetron5000/optparse-plus) generates
`./bin/lumione` and `./lib`, and a gemspec, so it's really worth using it.
